            <p>
                This study advances high-resolution CT image reconstruction from 2D X-rays, focusing on reducing radiation exposure and enhancing diagnostic precision. By addressing key shortcomings—such as projection distortions, low resolution, inefficiencies, and long training times—we significantly improved the PerX2CT algorithm. Our approach uses higher image resolution, optimized preprocessing, and EfficientNetV2 integration to overcome challenges faced by previous models like X2CT-GAN, pushing the limits of non-invasive imaging technology.
                To overcome previous deficiencies, we implemented several key innovations. We doubled the resolution of input X-rays from 128x128 to 256x256 pixels, greatly enhancing CT image quality. Preprocessing was optimized by excluding padded regions to ensure only relevant data is used. We also employed advanced style transfer techniques to harmonize general X-rays with synthetic ones, improving output consistency. The most substantial improvement involved replacing the outdated ResNet-101 encoder with EfficientNetV2, selected for its superior accuracy and efficiency, especially with larger datasets. Further optimization was achieved through stage-freezing during transfer learning, focusing on the extraction of local feature maps.
                The XR2CT model achieved a resolution of 256x256 pixels, delivering twice the detail of previous versions. The integration of EfficientNetV2 resulted in faster training and inference times while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Our padding detection method effectively eliminated irrelevant data, allowing computational resources to concentrate on meaningful regions. Notably, we reduced the number of parameters by approximately 100-fold. These innovations enabled more accurate, higher-resolution CT reconstructions with a significantly reduced computational load.
                The advancements presented in this study mark a substantial leap in CT reconstruction technology. By integrating EfficientNetV2 and refining our preprocessing techniques, we developed a model that enhances image quality and efficiency while significantly reducing radiation exposure. Our findings suggest that this approach could achieve super-resolution CT reconstructions up to 1024x1024 pixels, providing clinicians with ultra-high-definition diagnostic images of unparalleled detail and precision.
